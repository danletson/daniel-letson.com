      <p>by Daniel Letson, June 8 2019.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>In early May of 2019, LinkedIn completely overhauled its main marketing homepage, moving from a more formally "corporate" look and feel (lean, dark, no-nonsense) to a more friendly, approachable direction. The new site's aesthetic borrows from the successes of other young SaaS brands like Mailchimp and Slack, incorporating colorful illustration and a more inclusive editorial voice. The company's portfolio has expanded quite a bit in the past few years, and many of the site's underlying pages have not changed, leading to a somewhat disjointed user experience that is often vague in guiding the user to an appropriate conversion opportunity.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>I chose to tackle the design challenge with pragmatism. Many designers dream of crafting brand-new systems from whole cloth, but in my opinion, the key to developing a rewarding user experience is a commitment to constant testing and improvement. I spent the allotted time not sketching something totally new, but critiquing the existing site and brainstorming improvements to nudge the user experience towards the prompt ("better promote a single flow that helps potential users see the value of creating a LinkedIn profile and encourages them to do so.")</p>
      <p>As someone with experience in marketing, I did my best to think of how to remove friction from the new user flow, and present site visitors with scannable content that speaks to their needs. As a web developer, I decided to flex my coding chops to present my work as two interactive websites, with user experiences of their own.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Deliverables</h2>
      <p>An annotated version of the original LinkedIn.com design can be found <a href="original/" target="blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
      <p>A redesigned version can be found <a href="redesign/" target="blank" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
      <p>Both sites are marked with red dots ðŸ”´, which, when hovered, provide annotations explaining my critiques and thought process. Please view both sites on a desktop, in Chrome if possible.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Further Considerations</h2>
      <p>The majority of the changes proposed are simple enough to be validated with simple A/B or multivariate testing. With more time and resources, I would love to have been able to build out mobile styling, do cross-browser QA, spend more time with type hierarchies, explore animation, and derive a stand-alone style guide to more rigorously vet the changes outside of the homepage's specific context.</p>
