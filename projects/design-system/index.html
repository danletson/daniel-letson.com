        <h2>Design System</h2>
        <p><a href="https://fluxx.io" target="blank">Fluxx</a> is one of the world's most popular platforms for grants
          management. As an in-house senior product designer, I lead the creation of a design system to standardize UI
          and UX patterns for a mature, data-dense SaaS platform with more than 500 institutional clients and tens of
          thousands of daily users.</p>
        <p class="summary-stat"><strong>Problem:</strong> A fragmented user experience across client-configured sites
        </p>
        <p class="summary-stat"><strong>Goal:</strong> Standardization of common UI elements and streamlined development
          of new features</p>
        <p class="summary-stat"><strong>Team:</strong> 2 designers, 1 product manager, product and engineering
          leadership as stakeholders</p>
        <p class="summary-stat"><strong>Timeline:</strong> 6 months from planning to first implementation initiative</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>

        <p>Fluxx began as bespoke database software for a single nonprofit, growing over nearly a decade into an
          extremely robust and flexible SaaS platform, handling everything from form-building, to customer management,
          to custom Ruby scripting. During that process, tight timelines and a lack of design leadership had lead to a
          fragmented UI that was frustrating for users and diffucult for engineers to maintain.</p>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>In preparation for the development of a design system, my design partner and I started with a 2-week design
          sprint. We audited the existing app for usability issues, explored product parallels, and mocked up "ideal"
          states for the most common UX patterns.</p>

        <p>The results of the design sprint were socialized with product and technical leadership, and lead to the
          creation of the platform's first full-on design system.</p>

        <p>From this holistic view, we set about isolating and standardizing the building blocks of a universally
          applicable design system. Spacing, colors, and typography guidelines were built in Figma, and used as the
          foundation for the development of subsequent components and patterns. Eventually, these values were published
          as platform-agnostic design tokens, to streamline the building process for our developers.</p>

        <p>While building a new front end from scratch would have been ideal, there weren't enough engineering resources
          to support such a giant project. Instead, the design team collaborated with product managers to isolate
          upcoming new features to start building design-system aligned components opportunistically. This way, every
          sprint included work to flesh out the React library of design system components and patterns.</p>

        <p>I worked closely with engineers to fine-tune the structure of the built prototypes, and contributed usability
          tweaks to the developed prototypes directly via Git. I also designed a documentation site for Fluxx engineers,
          with live examples of React components and exportable code snippets.</p>

        <h3>Solution & Further Considerations</h3>
        <p>After designing and compiling hundreds of individual patterns and variants, the Fluxx design system is now in
          regular use, powering dozens of shipped features. The library comprises <a
            href="https://www.figma.com/file/S2hU0lc4xaZ86RXlx5SOyL/Fluxx-Design-System---Tokens?type=design&node-id=314%3A6166&mode=design&t=pN6YOFSdeHrut3D1-1">portable
            design tokens</a>, <a
            href="https://www.figma.com/file/cgXV2WmZILbfuEejyaJeNU/Fluxx-Design-System---Components-(Community)?type=design&node-id=569%3A1880&mode=design&t=51ncckBOSb1CvNMM-1"></a>UI
          components, a CI/CD pipeline for automated and manual QA, and an internal documentation site. New feature
          development has massively accelerated, and even retrofitting legacy components takes less time thanks to the
          tokenization of core styles.</p>

        <p>While components built with the new design system have been well-received by users, I would have liked more
          time in the process to put more holistic examples of design system patterns through user acceptance testing.
          The incremental approach that Fluxx favored was a business necessity, but being able to build a brand-new
          front end would have had a much bigger impact on the user experience, and would have allowed for true A/B
          testing of new and old components.</p>
