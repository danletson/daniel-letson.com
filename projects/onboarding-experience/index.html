        <h2>Onboarding Experience</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom:24px;"><a href="https://grantseeker.io" target="blank">Grantseeker</a> is a SaaS
          productivity tool for nonprofits, which helps them track the grants they've received, communicate with
          funders,
          and search for new funding opportunities. As a product designer on the Grantseeker team, I helped to design a
          new onboarding flow that would get new users working with real data in less than a minute.</p>
        <p class="summary-stat"><strong>Problem: </strong>New signups struggled to quickly comprehend the value of the
          Grantseeker platform</p>
        <p class="summary-stat"><strong>Goal: </strong>A new onboarding flow to turn casual signups into paying
          customers
          in less than 14 days</p>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>Grantseeker's initial open beta was free-to-use for all initial signups. When I joined the team, a pivot to
          freemium was underway, and the key to turning casual users into paying subscribers was a quick, effective
          onboarding flow.</p>

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>Our initial research started with identifying the "real" data that grantees cared about most in their offline
          work, and innovating ways to get it precisely modeled in the app as quickly as possible.</p>
        <p>My design partner and I collaborated with our engineers to identify the types of record creation that
          correlated most highly with regular visits, and began to sketch friendly ways to nudge new users towards
          getting
          these records set up.</p>

        <p>Initial versions shepherded new users through value propositions and explained the types of work they'd be
          doing, along with a homepage checklist.</p>

      <div class="copy-container">
        <p>Unfortunately, usage analytics revealed that users rarely engaged with these walkthrough steps, and most new
          signups were not successfully creating "real" data on their first visit. We'd need to cut the effort required
          even further to acheive the stickiness we were hoping for.</p>

        <h3>Solution & Further Considerations</h3>
        <p>
          After consultation with marketing and engineering, the value proposition flow was cut in favor of an optional
          video, and the checklist of "must-do" actions was cut from 5 steps to 3.</p>
        <p>
          Our biggest innovation in getting users onboarded quickly came from leveraging public data. Utilizing
          government
          public-records APIs, we were able to architect a flow that would get a user up and running with their first
          "real" data in <strong>less than a minute</strong>, borrowing from quick-start social media patterns like
          "find
          your friends" or "who to follow".
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>A user provides the name of their organization at signup</li>
          <li>A pre-populated search lets the user select their org from a list</li>
          <li>An API call pulls in all the funders that have previously given to that org, according to government
            records.</li>
          <li>The user creates records for all of their funders in a single click</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The new onboarding flow is highly effective at getting new users set up quickly, but the built-in logic is
          rather simplistic. If I had more time and resources on the project, I would have loved to further investigate
          branching flows for different types of users, prospect scoring, and smarter targeting logic for nudges. </p>
