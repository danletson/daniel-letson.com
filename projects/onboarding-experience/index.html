      <p style="margin-bottom:24px;"><a href="https://grantseeker.io" target="blank">Grantseeker</a> is a SaaS productivity tool for nonprofits, which helps them track the grants they've received, communicate with funders, and search for new funding opportunities. Following a freemium model, the platform relies on turning casual users into regular users, and regular users into paying subscribers. As a product designer on the Grantseeker team, I helped to design a new onboarding flow that would get <strong>new users working with real data in less than a minute</strong>. We isolated the initial user actions most highly correlated with stickiness, and used contextual tips to progressively reveal deeper functionality inside the app.</p>

      <h3>
        Starting with the data
      </h3>
      <p>
        As with any customer-facing project, we'd have to start with the goal (a new signup becoming a return user) and work backwards. But what did it mean to be "fully onboarded" and likely to return? In the case of Grantseeker, a productivity tool that lets users structure their day-to-day work in a new way, it meant having real data in the app that models precisely the work they already manage.  
      </p>
      <p>
        My design partner and I collaborated with our engineers to identify patterns of our beta users' data that are most highly correlated with regular use (multiple visits per week over a period of 3 months). Un-surprisingly, the all the biggest indicators of regular use came down to "having more records in the system." We winnowed down the list of potential record-creation / customization categories to a "top 3", and worked towards the goal of getting our new users established with all three in less than 10 minutes from signup. Here's the list:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create a "funder" (a "funder" is a parent record to a grant)</li>
        <li>Create an "grant" (the core of the app, related to a single "funder")</li>
        <li>Create a "task" (a "to-do" for the user themselves or another person within their account, this is the most sticky, but can't exist without the first two!)</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>A little open-source magic</h3>
      <p>
        One of the trickiest things about onboarding users to Grantseeker specifically is the "terror of the blank page." While the platform has all kinds of great tools to help nonprofits manage their work, the reality is that moving one's work from an ad-hoc system like Excel (or even pen & paper!) means spending a lot of time trying to re-creating what already exists. Getting to "real" data can be daunting. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Apps in other verticals have all kinds of solutions to this, from social media "find your friends" flows to retail recommendation algorithms, but productivity is trickier. Fortunately for the Grantseeker team, the fact that all of our users are registered nonprofits meant we had a trick up our sleeve: public data! 
      </p>
      <div class="image">
        <figure>
          <picture>
            <img src="../../img/onboarding-experience-2.png" alt="Onboarding modal: public data found">
          </picture>
          <figcaption>
            Onboarding modal: public data found!
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>
        Utilizing public-records APIs, we were able to architect a flow that would get a user up and running with their first "real" data in <strong>less than a minute</strong>. Here's how:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A user provides the name of their organization at signup</li>
        <li>After an intro slide, they're given pre-loaded search results with the opportunity to select their org from the list</li>
        <li>Using the EIN of the signup org, asynchronous API calls pull in all the funders that have previously given to that org, according to government records.</li>
        <li>The user selects any or all of the funders they want to keep track of, and adds them all in one click.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Easy peasy! (And an order of magnitude simpler than importing a user's own records).</p>
      <h3>Keeping it light</h3>
      <p>To shepherd new users through the flow, I designed a new icon library, extending our UI icons with brand colors and transparency effects. Playful, legible, and on-brand.</p>
      <div class="image">

        </figure>
      </div>
      <p>After initial onboarding, users are fed a drip campaign of super-lightweight "tips", to nudge them into socializing the app with their coworkers and further integrate Grantseeker's tools with their day-to-day work.</p>
