        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p><a href="https://fluxx.io" target="blank">Fluxx</a> is an industry-leading cloud platform for grants
          management, used by dozens of the world’s most well-known foundations and charitable nonprofits. As lead
          product designer, I designed a new component to help funders analyze the demographic makeup of grantee
          organizations
          in order to hit institutional goals.</p>

        <h3>Problems</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Grant-making organizations struggle to collect demographic information from their grantees</li>
          <li>Analysis of demographic information happens outside normal review workflows, and often requires technical
            knowledge</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Integrate third-party data into Fluxx workflows, with an external source of truth (Candid)</li>
          <li>Provide actionable insights for users of all skill levels</li>
          <li>Maintain accessibility standards (WCAG 2.2 AA)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          In 2023, Fluxx was approached by longtime partner <a href="https://candid.org">Candid</a> with the opportunity
          to integrate self-reported demographic data from potential grantees, enabling clients to make more informed
          decisions around giving, and to hit institutional goals for supporting under-represented groups. The data
          delivered by Candid is fairly fixed, but determining how it should be "reported" to grant-makers was an
          opportunity to differentiate.

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>
          From the beginning of the project, it was obvious that charts would be a natural fit for making data
          scannable,
          accessible, and useful. However, the sensitive context of the data collected (categorizing people by their
          race,
          ethnicity, sexual orientation, etc) and a non-negotiable minimum of WCAG 2.2 AA compliance made this specific
          use case especially challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much of the data delivered by Candid is simply counts of employees at a specific nonprofit by demographic
          category, like <strong>Race & Ethnicity, Gender Identity, Disability Status</strong> etc. Visualizing this
          kind
          of categorical data is relatively simple, but starting with a critique of Candid’s own internal charts, a few
          challenges presented themselves:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Many categories, up to ten per chart</li>
          <li>Using only color to encode data</li>
          <li>Use of several semantically charged colors, like red and green</li>
          <li>Accessibility issues like low color contrast and no tabular data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          One of the biggest, and most potentially fraught decisions in building out our data visualizations was picking
          appropriate colors. After lots of competitive research in the space, my design partner and I came to the
          conclusion that <em>the vast majority of data visualizations on the web do not take color
            seriously.</em> Accessibility, legibility, and actionability are often thrown out the window for
          harmonious or “eye-catching” palettes, even in industry-leading products.
        </p>
        <p>
          We set out to select 10 categorical colors that were:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>WCAG 2.2 AA-compliant against white</li>
          <li>Semantically neutral</li>
          <li>Brand-aligned</li>
          <li>Differentiable at a distance</li>
          <li>Differentiable to users with various color-blindness conditions</li>
        </ul>

          Solution & Further Considerations
        </h3>
        <p>
          The shipped solution delivered approachable visualizations with one-click access to the underlying data,
          encoded
          with comfortably spaced, easily distinguishable stacked bars. Hover states for both the charts and the tables
          highlight specific segments for legibility. Conditionally styled inline micro-charts in the data table make it
          easy to determine the biggest segment in each category in cases where the stacked bars might be ambiguous.

          While the delivered component is very useful for reviewing grantee organizations one-by-one, the real power in
          this kind of data comes from aggregation and automation. Executives want to know not just the composition of a
          single nonprofit, but how the demographics of their entire giving portfolio stack up. Fluxx plans to build out
          more robust reporting infrastructure to support these use cases in the future.
