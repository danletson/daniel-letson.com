        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p><a href="https://fluxx.io" target="blank">Fluxx</a> is an industry-leading cloud platform for grants
          management, used by dozens of the world’s most well-known foundations and charitable nonprofits. As lead
          product designer, I research, designed, and prototyped new workflows to help non-technical users create
          reports and understand their data.</p>

        <h3>Problems</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Daily users can't get the data they need out of the platform
            because they often don't understand how their data is structured</li>
          <li>Semantically similar fields and data entropy over time lead to confusion</li>
          <li>Existing data export tools don't match users mental models of their day-to-day work</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduce friction in report creation</li>
          <li>Provide users with insights about the shape and scope of their data</li>
          <li>Reduce reliance on support agents and admins for reporting workload</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Background</h3>

        <p>The primary unit of Grantmaker’s UI is a “card”, or a filtered list of records. Most daily users build up
          dashboards of cards, laid out in a specific order to support their approval workflows. </p>
        <p>The data that underlies these card dashboards is extremely specific and complex, and many users have a hard
          time analyzing the data that makes up their day-to-day-work. Admin users have access to robust reporting
          tools, but when most staff need answers to questions like “How much total giving has my program done so far
          this
          year?”, many were lost and frustrated.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="copy-container">

        <h3>Process</h3>
        <p>To understand the issues Fluxx users were having in finding and leveraging their data, the team set up a
          series
          of interview-style research sessions with volunteer users. My design partner and I conducted seven 45-minute
          interactive sessions via Zoom. We encouraged our interviewees to narrate their thought process and pain points
          as they navigated a report-creation workflow. We took turns leading the sessions and taking detailed notes.

      </div>
      <div class="copy-container">
        <p>By the end of this interview process, we'd heard dozens of complaints like:</p>
        <blockquote>
          “My admin only allows us to run reports, not create them. Often the data I want is missing, but I don’t know
          how
          to get to it”
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          “I have some access to reporting, but it’s intimidating. There are hundreds of fields on each record. I don’t
          know where to start to find my data.”
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          “Sometimes I’ll export everything and just delete 90% of it, it’s easier than trying to build out what I need”
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          The collected insights were transcribed from the interview notes, anonymized, and organized by theme in
          Airtable
          for further analysis.

        <h3>
          Solution
        </h3>
        <p>
          Helping our daily users find and deliver simple metrics about their records was a matter of combining multiple
          interfaces that were formally different but categorically the same. The final designs involved several new
          flows
          to guide users from their lists of records through to a streamlined report building interface, along with an
          overhaul of the system's standard data visualizations and field lists.

        <h3>Further Considerations</h3>
        <p>Although the research was well conducted and considered, the project was de-prioritized due to
          complexity,
          with engineering resources diverted to developing a third-party platform for data analysis and reporting. If
          the project were
          reopened, I would have liked to explore a solution that integrated more wizard-like flows to guide
          users
          through reporting, along with robust user acceptance testing. </p>
